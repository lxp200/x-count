# x-count

X-Count is a simple, original game that I created as part of our very first course on user interfaces.

The goal is to visually guess the percentage of X characters displayed in the grid, as fast as you can.

Once you press Start, you can do everything from the keyboard by hitting Return to either validate your guess or restart the game if you press it another time.
